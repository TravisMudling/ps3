# Problem Set 3

For this problem set, your task is to build a products page for an e-commerce website using AJAX and TypeScript.

## Requirements

1. On page load, product information should be loaded from the backend via AJAX (see included Postman collection).
2. After the data is loaded successfully, the products are displayed on the page as demonstrated.
3. If the data was not loaded successfully, an error message saying "Failed to load products" should be displayed.

## Working on this PS

- Before anything else, install dependencies by running `npm install`.
- The file you need to edit is `src/main.ts`. Everything else is provided for you. You can modify the CSS and HTML if you want, so long as the requirements are still satisfied.
- You must compile your TypeScript code to test it on a browser. Run `tsc` in a terminal or command prompt to do this.
- Optionally, run `tsc -w` to run the compiler in watch mode (i.e. compiles automatically on save). Keep the terminal open in the background.

## Submission
Zip the project folder (`ps3`) and upload to the prescribed folder.
